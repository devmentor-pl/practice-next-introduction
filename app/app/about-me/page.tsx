When you land on a sample web page or open an email template and see content beginning with "lorem ipsum," the page creator placed that apparent gibberish there on purpose.

Page layouts look better with something in each section. Web page designers, content writers, and layout artists use lorem ipsum, also known as placeholder copy, to distinguish which areas on a page will hold advertisements, editorials, and filler before the final written content and website designs receive client approval.

Fun Lorem Ipsum text may appear in any size and font to simulate everything you create for your campaigns.

The use of the lorem ipsum passage dates back to the 1500s. When printing presses required painstaking hand-setting of type, workers needed something to show clients how their pages would look. To save time, they turned to Cicero's words, creating sample books filled with preset paragraphs.

However, it wasn't until the 1960s that the passage became common when Letraset revolutionized the advertising industry with its transfer sheets. These innovative sheets allowed designers to apply pre-printed lorem ipsum text in various fonts and formats directly onto their mockups and prototypes.

The familiar "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" text emerged when 16th-century printers adapted Cicero's original work, beginning with the phrase "dolor sit amet consectetur.</p>
